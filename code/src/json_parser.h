* TODO General description
*
* Currently, only limited support for serialized JSON streams is provided,
* loosely based on \"<a href="tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC 7159 - The
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format</a>\".
* More specifically,
*
* TODO Specify what *is* supported. Basically, objects (not nested) with values
*   of type integer (unsigned) and string, of the specified keys and
*   resolution/size.
*
* According to the specification, any number of insignificant white-space may
* occur around a structural character the latter being a sequence of a
* white-space followed by a reserved character and another white-space (*RFC
* 7159 p.5*), eg:@verbatim
begin-object    = ws %x7B ws  ; { left curly bracket
@endverbatim
* None of the parser functions will fail if either of the above specified
* leading or trailing white-space is not present.
*
* TODO Complete the following:
* The predominant function is #json_parse() which
*
* TODO Change this "All the providedâ€¦" to something more appropriate, since most
*   of them are static (global within this compilation unit):
* All the provided json_parse_* functions are strict in the sense they fail fast
* upon any unexpected occurrence. This lack of leniency provides greater
* minimalism and, thus, requires less program space. Successful completion is
* indicated by a return value of @c 0, whereas failure, by a negative value
* (typically, #OTHER or #EOF). These functions, of course, use one another.
* Currently, should any one of them fail will cause the others to fail, as well;
* #json_parse() will return that value.
*
* Members contain a key of type @c string. All strings begin and end with
* quotation marks (RFC 7159 p.8). See #json_parse_object().
*
* TODO Specify what are the required *extern* components (for instance, function
*   to read one character at a time and a string matcher) and the overall
*   architecture, which brings to the following:
*
* In order for this component to be operable it needs to be provided with the
* following:
*   - @code int8_t (*gnext)(uint8_t*)@endcode
*   - @code int8_t (*gmatch)(uint8_t**, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t*)@endcode
*

/*
* TODO Include definition of #OTHER (and perhaps #EOF), *after* they have been
*   defined in appropriate files.

/**
* @brief Parse the stream for a serialized JSON object.
*
* Nested objects are not supported at this time.
*
* When called, @p c should contain the left curly bracket '{' (0x7b) of the
* object to parse (`begin-object'). Upon normal completion (return value @c 0),
* the character pointed to by @c p is its corresponding right curly bracket '}'
* (0x7d) (`end-object').
*
* This function uses #json_parse_member() which in turn uses
* #json_parse_value(). As stated before, they are all strict against unexpected
* occurrences. As far as this function is concerned, it means than all objects
* must start and end with a pair of curly brackets, optionally containing any
* number of members separated with *one* value-separator (*RFC 7159 p.6*):
* @verbatim
object = begin-object [ member *( value-separator member ) ]
         end-object

member = string name-separator value@endverbatim
*
* What is more important, though, is that a @c member's key is a @c string, and
* all strings start and end within quotation-marks (*RFC 7159 p.8*). As a
* result, this function will fail (return value @c #OTHER) should a key be
* specified without quotation-marks.
*
* Only keys specified in @p info may be accepted, the order of which is
* irrelevant (see #json_parse_member()).
*
* @param[in,out] info Provides the acceptable keys and a additional information
*   (for an explanation, see #ParamInfo).
* @param[in,out] c The first character to start parsing from and the last one
*   read from the stream. Upon invocation, it should point to '{' (0x7b).
* @returns One of:
*   - @c 0; if the object was successfully parsed and no errors have occurred.
*   - #OTHER; if an invalid character has occurred at any stage during
*       processing.
*   - #EOF; if end-of-stream was reached at any point.

* When calling this, @p c should point to '"' (double quote) to designate the
* start of a key (keys are defined as strings and are, thus, enclosed within
* quotation marks). The input stream is matched against the values included in
* @p info (member @link #ParamInfo::tokens tokens@endlink) using the externally
* provided
* stream_match()
* function in an attempt to locate one of those keys/tokens. If it succeeds, the
* return value (status) of this function depends on the outcome of parsing the
* identified key's value by #json_parse_value(). On the contrary, if it happens
* upon a key that is not included in @p info, the operation stops (fails) and
* #OTHER is returned.
*
* @param[in,out] info Provides the acceptable keys and a additional information
*   (for an explanation, see #ParamInfo).
* @param[in,out] c The first character to start parsing from and the last one

* @returns One of:
*   - @c 0; if a member (key/value pair) with a key defined in @p info was
*       successfully parsed.
*   - #OTHER; if an invalid character has occurred at any stage during
*       processing.
*   - #EOF; if end-of-stream was reached at any point.
