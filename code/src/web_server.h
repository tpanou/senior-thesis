/**
* @brief Advances the stream until all successive linear white space has been

*
* This function is mostly useful for removing spacing as well as header folding
* within a header body. A linear white space -- LWS, for short -- is defined by
* <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.3">IETF RFC 288 p.10</a>,
* as: @verbatim 1*([CRLF] LWSP-char) @endverbatim
* ie, an optional CRLF sequence immediately followed by a SPACE or HTAB any
* amount of times. For clarification, a CRLF sequence followed by SPACE or HTAB,
* causes header folding and not its termination.
*
* @param[in,out] c The first character to start discarding from and the last one
*   read from the stream.
* @returns One of:
*   - #CRLF; for header termination.
*   - #OTHER; if any non-LWS has been read. That character will have been read
*       into @p c.
*   - EOF; if the end of stream has been reached.
