* @brief Velocity setting for OCR1B to move along the positive direction on axis
* X.
*
* With a total of 5000 increments in Timer/Counter1, a PWM signal with,
* approximately, 5 to 10% duty cycle is produced with pulses that remain high
* for 250 to 500 increments, respectively. Pulses below 7.5% (ie, from 250 up to
* approx. 375) result in a Counter-Clockwise (CCW) rotation; the lower the
* value, the greater the angular velocity. Similarly, increments in the range
* 375 up to 500 produce Clockwise (CW) rotation. In this case, the greater the
* value, the greater the angular velocity, as well. Increments around 375 force
* the motor to retain its position (brakes).
*
* In practice, the values around the middle point (7.5% duty cycle) are *not*
* symmetric, in the sense that, for example, 350 and 400 do *not* necessarily
* produce angular velocities of the same magnitude. The exact behaviour is
* strictly dependent on each motor and could differ even among motors of the
* same model. In the current configuration, calibration tests have been
* performed to determine duty cycles that result in similar velocities for axes
* X and Y. This was deemed necessary to ensure smooth operation when motion in
* both these axes is requested (see #setup_axis() and #setup_lock()).
*
* While the motors are rotating, the belt and pinion linear actuator converts
* rotational to linear motion in an either increasing or decreasing direction;
* it is the positioning of the motors that determines what CW and CCW rotation
* corresponds to. In case of axes X and Z, CW rotation increases the position
* (ie, moves the apparatus in a greater position in device-space coordinates),
* while the opposite holds true for axis Y.
*
* Values producing duty cycles on axes X, Y and Z:
* - Axis X:
*   - Increment: @c 411
*   - Decrement: @c 345
* - Axis Y:
*   - Increment: @c 350
*   - Decrement: @c 412
* - Axis Z:
*   - Increment: @c 415
*   - Decrement: @c 365
