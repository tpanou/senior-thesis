    * is interpreted as the state indicator. During initialisation (see init()),
    * the set of acceptable states are specified along with their respective
    * handler functions.
    *
    * The URI fragment may, optionally, contain comma-separated strings, each a
    * parameter followed by a colon and a value. When calling update() to prompt
    * PageMonitor for a page renewal, the current fragment is split into an
    * array of such strings. The first string is the state indicator. The rest,
    * are converted into an object (see makeParams()) and passed into the
    * corresponding handler.
